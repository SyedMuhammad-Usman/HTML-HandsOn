HTML entities are a way to represent characters in HTML that have special meanings in the HTML syntax or are not easily typed on a keyboard. They are used to ensure that these characters are displayed correctly on web pages. HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Common HTML Entities
Reserved Characters
Certain characters are reserved in HTML because they are part of the HTML syntax. To display these characters correctly, they need to be replaced with their corresponding HTML entities.
Ampersand (&): &amp;
Less than (<): &lt;
Greater than (>): &gt;
Double Quote ("): &quot;
Single Quote ('): &apos; or &#39;

Non-breaking Space
The non-breaking space ( ) is used to insert spaces in a text that should not be collapsed by the browser.
Non-breaking Space: &nbsp;

Other Characters
HTML entities are also used to display characters that might not be available on all keyboards or to add special symbols to your text.
Copyright (©): &copy;
Registered Trademark (®): &reg;
Euro (€): &euro;
Trademark (™): &trade;
Section (§): &sect;

Numeric Character References
In addition to named entities, characters can also be represented by numeric character references. These can be either decimal or hexadecimal.
Ampersand (&): &#38; or &#x26;
Less than (<): &#60; or &#x3C;
Greater than (>): &#62; or &#x3E;
Double Quote ("): &#34; or &#x22;
Single Quote ('): &#39; or &#x27;


pre & code tag:


Certainly! Here are a few examples of code snippets that are typically enclosed within `<code>` tags to indicate that they are code fragments:

1. HTML Elements and Attributes:
   ```html
   <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;</code>
   ```

2. CSS Selectors:
   ```css
   <code>.container {
       width: 100%;
       margin: 0 auto;
   }</code>
   ```

3. JavaScript Functions or Variables:
   ```javascript
   <code>function greet(name) {
       return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
   }</code>
   ```

4. Command-Line Commands:
   ```bash
   <code>npm install package-name</code>
   ```

5. Inline Code Snippets in Text:
   ```html
   To create a link in HTML, use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
   ```

In each of these examples, the `<code>` tag is used to encapsulate the code snippet, making it visually distinct and indicating its purpose as code. This helps readers easily identify and understand the code within the context of the surrounding text.
