First Input Delay (FID)
What is FID?

FID measures the time it takes for a webpage to respond to the first user interaction (like clicking a link, tapping a button, or entering text) after it has loaded.
Why it matters:

A low FID means the page is quickly interactive, providing a better user experience.
A high FID can frustrate users, making the site feel slow and unresponsive.
How to improve it:

Reduce JavaScript execution time: Optimize and defer non-essential scripts.
Break up long tasks: Split up long-running tasks to keep the main thread free.
Use browser features like lazy loading: Load images and other resources only when needed.
Improve server response times: Optimize server performance to reduce delays.
Example:

High FID: A user clicks a button, but it takes a noticeable time before the page responds.
Low FID: A user clicks a button, and the page responds almost immediately.
