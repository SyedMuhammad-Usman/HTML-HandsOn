    <h1>Code Formating</h1>
    <p>Code formating is the process of arranging the code in a neat and organized manner to make it easier to read and understand "by coder".<br>
    so we going to use pre tag so that it does care about white spaces and use break line.
     </p>



     <h2>PRE TAG</h2>
     pre tag take white space in consideration & line break. OR preserve white spaces and break line
     <pre>
        Some     stuff     here
        second   line      here
     </pre>





     <h2>Code tag</h2>
     while code tag not take white space in consideration and line break OR not preserve white spaces and break line<br>

     So basically code tag is used to denote/highlight code snippets
     <code>
        Some     stuff     here
        second   line      here
     </code>


     <h1>Summary</h1>
The pre tag is used for preformatted text, and the code tag is used to denote/highlight code snippets for only coder.
